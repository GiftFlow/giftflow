Terms of Use

THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE TERMS ON WHICH GiftFlow INC. OFFERS YOU ACCESS TO OUR SITE AND SERVICES.

Welcome to the Web site operated by CouchSurfing International, Inc. ("we," "us"), 
a Non-Profit Corporation. We maintain this Web site, CouchSurfing.org (our "Site"), as a service to 
our visitors (our Site and such services, collectively, our "Services"). By using this Site, you 
agree to comply with and be legally bound by the following terms of use ("Terms"), whether or not you 
become a registered user of the Services.

Please review the following terms carefully. If you do not agree to these terms, you have no right to 
obtain information from or otherwise continue using this Site. Failure to use this Site in accordance 
with the following terms of use may subject you to severe civil and criminal penalties. We reserve the
right to make changes to these terms at any time. Your continued use of our Services constitutes your 
acceptance of such changes. Accordingly, you should review these terms from time to time for such changes.

1. USER RESPONSIBILITY

1.1 Our Site is a Venue. Our Services do not include the introduction of users to one another. 
Our Site is merely a venue for users to learn about one another and, if they wish, exchange gifts with one another. 
We are not involved in the actual contact between users. As a result, we have no control over the conduct of our
users or the truth or accuracy of the information that users post on the Site.

1.2 Identity Verification. Because user verification on the Internet is difficult, we cannot and do 
not confirm each user’s purported identity. Although we provide tools intended to assist you, you are responsible 
for determining the identity and suitability of others with whom you may match by means of this Site. 
We do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services. We do not investigate any user’s 
reputation, conduct, morality, criminal background, or verify the information such user may submit 
to the Site. We encourage you to communicate directly with other users through the tools available on the Site 
and to take the same precautions you would normally take when meeting a stranger in person for the first time.

1.3 Your Experience with Other Users. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users 
of our Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with 
other users of our Services. We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor interactions between
you and other users of our Services and to take any other action in good faith to restrict access to or 
the availability of any material that we or another user of our Services may consider obscene, lewd, 
lascivious, filthy, violent, harassing or otherwise objectionable.


1.4 Release. Because our Site is merely a venue, in the event that you have a dispute with one or more users, 
you release us (and our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from claims, 
demands and damages (actual and consequential) of every kind and nature, known and unknown, suspected and unsuspected, 
disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with such disputes. If you are a California 
resident, you waive California Civil Code 1542, which says: "A general release does not extend to 
claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing 
the release, which if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor."


2. USER CONDUCT. In your use of our Services, you must act responsibly and exercise good judgment. 
By way of example and not limitation, you shall not:

(a) violate any applicable law or regulation;

(b) infringe the rights of any third party, including without limitation, intellectual property, 
privacy, publicity or contractual rights;

(c) use information obtained through our Services for any unauthorized purpose;

(d) interfere with or damage our Services, including, without limitation, through the use of viruses,

(e) use our Services to transmit, distribute, post or submit any information concerning any other 
person or entity, including without limitation, photographs of others without their permission, personal
contact information or credit, debit, calling card or account numbers;

e-mail or any other e-mail of a commercial, religious or political or other nature not within the 
intended purposes of the Services);

(h) collect or store any information about any other user other than for purposes of the permitted use of our Services;

(j) register for more than one user account or register for a user account on behalf of an individual other than yourself;

with any person or entity, whether by providing or omitting to provide information;

(m) assist any third party in doing any of the foregoing.

3. MINORS MAY NOT USE SERVICES. You must be at least 18 years old to register to use the Services. 
By registering to use our Services, you represent that you are over 18.

4. PRIVACY. We understand the concerns that you may have about your privacy and respect your right to 
protect your personal information while online. However, our Services are designed to allow users to post
photographs and information about themselves for public review and comment. Accordingly, by submitting 
your photograph and/or any other personal information, you waive any privacy expectations you have with 
respect to use of such likeness or personal information. If you do not wish to have your picture or 
information about yourself viewed by or disclosed to others, do not use our Services. We may collect 
certain other personal information from you that we do not post on our Site. In most cases, we do not 
intentionally transfer this information to unaffiliated third parties without your consent. However, we 
reserve the right to transfer such information without your consent to prevent an emergency, to protect or 
enforce our rights, to protect or enforce the rights of a third party or in response to a court order or

15. INDEMNITY. You shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless us (and each of our officers, directors,
members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim, demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense,
including without limitation reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out or relating to your use of our 
Services or alleging facts or circumstances that could constitute a breach of any provision of these 
Terms by you. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole and unfettered 
discretion, to control any action or proceeding and determine whether we wish to settle it, and if so, on what terms.

who steals from you or engages in any other disturbing conduct, you must immediately report such person
to the appropriate authorities and to us by contacting at info@giftflow.org; provided that your report shall not 
obligate us to take any action or cause us to incur any liability.

17. MEETINGS. Many in-person meetings are held by groups of interested members and are not sponsored
or organized by us. Members who organize meetings should make clear in their announcements, invitations 
and signage that their meetings have not been organized or approved, and are not run, by us. We cannot 
guarantee the quality, organization or safety of any in-person meeting (whether or not sponsored by us). 
Members attend meetings at their own risk.


18. LANGUAGES. The translation of any portion of this Site into another language is for your convenience 
only. Like any automated translation technology, the on-line third-party translation application used 
on this Site is susceptible to inaccuracy. You may rely only on the original, English-language version of this Site.

19. DISPUTES. In the event a dispute arises between you and us, our goal is to provide you with a 
neutral and cost-effective means to resolve the dispute quickly. Accordingly, any claim or controversy 
at law or equity that arises out of these Terms or our Services ("Claim") shall be resolved in
accordance with one of the subsections below or as we may otherwise agree in writing. Before 
resorting to these alternatives, we strongly encourage you to contact us directly to seek a resolution. 
We will consider reasonable requests to resolve the dispute through alternative dispute resolution ("ADR")
procedures, such as mediation, as an alternative to litigation.

(a) Binding Arbitration. For any Claim (excluding Claims for injunctive or other equitable relief) 
where the total amount of the award sought is less than Ten Thousand US Dollars (US$10,000),
you or we may elect to resolve the dispute through binding arbitration conducted by telephone, on-line
and/or based solely upon written submissions where no in-person appearance is required. In such cases,
the arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association in accordance with its 
applicable rules, or any other established ADR provider agreed upon by the parties. Any judgment on 
the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

(b) Court. Alternatively, any Claim may be adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction located 
in Connecticut, USA or where the defendant is located (in our case New Haven, CT, USA, and in your case your home address). 
You and we agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of a state court located in Connecticut or a US federal court 
located in Connecticut.

(c) Alternative Dispute Resolution. Alternatively, we will consider use of other forms of ADR, such 
as binding arbitration to be held in Connecticut, USA or another location agreed upon by the parties.

(d) Attorney’s Fees. All Claims (excluding requests for injunctive or equitable relief) between the 
parties must be resolved using the dispute-resolution mechanism that is selected in accordance with
this Section 19 by the first party to file a Claim. Should either party file an action contrary to 
this Section 19, the other party may recover attorneys’ fees and costs up to US$5,000, provided that
the party seeking the award has notified the other party in writing of the improperly filed Claim, 
and the other party has failed to withdraw the Claim.

20. NOTICES. Any notices or other communications required or contemplated by these Terms shall be in 
writing and shall be deemed given (a) three (3) business days after being sent by certified or registered 
mail with return receipt, or (b) one (1) business day after being sent by reputable express courier 
service with tracking capability. Such notices shall be addressed to a party as follows, or to such 
other address as such party may designate by notice from time to time:

(a) to us at

GiftFlow Inc.
Attention: Legal Notices
216 Dwight St.
New Haven, CT, 06511
United States

and (b) to you, if you are a registered user, at the latest address you have provided in connection 
with your registration to use our Services.

21. MISCELLANEOUS. These Terms shall be interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of Connecticut, USA, 
without regard to conflict-of-law principles. These Terms contain the entire agreement, and supersede 
all prior and contemporaneous understandings, between the parties regarding their subject matter. 
Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under these Terms shall not 
operate as a waiver thereof. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which shall remain in 
full force and effect. We may assign our agreement with you. Headings of sections are for convenience
only and shall not be used to limit or construe such sections. Sections 1.5 (Release), 4 (Privacy), 
5.1 (License), 6 (Third-Party Content), 7 (Proprietary Rights), 14 (Limits on Liability), 15 (Indemnity), 
18 (Languages), 19 (Disputes), 20 (Notices) and this Section 21 (Miscellaneous) shall survive any 
termination or expiration of these Terms.


Please <a href="mailto:info@giftflow.org">Contact Us</a> with any questions regarding these Terms.

Your continued use of this Site and registration to use our Services is contingent upon your 
agreement to be bound by the foregoing Terms of Use.

Hello and Welcome to the GiftFlow Database!

IMPORTANT TIP: If you use the Summoner to create a fake database -- the password to all the fake accounts is 'giftflow'.

This manual will guide you through setting up a development environment database, complete with a set of fake data of whatever size you want.

This directory contains a gift.sql file and a defaults.sql file. Both filenames start with the date of their creation, so you know what version of the database you are setting up.


DATE_gift.sql is the database structure. Create a blank database then import this file first.

DATE_defaults.sql contains all the functional data that the app needs (email templates, categories, events, etc......)
Import this second to have an empty, but functional application.

Summoner is a tool for creating a set of test data to use in your development environment.
To use the Summoner, open up summon.php and set the totals to whatever you want them to be. 
Try to stick to the same relative proportions. No more transactions than goods.
Save summon.php and then run it in your browser. It should generate a file called balrog.sql.
Import balrog.sql into your database (after gift and defaults) and you should be good to go.
You may run into file permission issues when running the Summoner. Just set the permissions of the 
summon directory to allow all. 

Configure your database settings in application/config/database.php


Schema.pdf is a useful map of the data struture. It might be a little out of date. Peruse it to get an idea of the database.

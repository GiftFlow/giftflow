k new feature idea for GiftFlow here

lets get this down in the terminal so it looks like we are working,

CAll it the GRatitude 

A very easy - Portal
Post a thank you note for someone- A way to thank them for giving to you
The transaction process is too clumsy for this. The person wants to reciprocate by thanking them online, 
recording that thank you into a system where they would be able to redeem it
by asking for other gifts


-give the persona's name, eamil, facebook them - select them from existing giftflow users
thgen we email them about the thank you and encourage them to register. the 
thank you then goes into a review on their profile!!!!


DAMN i need the money to build this!

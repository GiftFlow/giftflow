<h2>GiftFlow Transparency</h2>

<p> As an organization, we are incorporated as a non-profit in the 
state of Connecticut. We have not yet applied for 501c3 status with the federal government. We plan on submitting
our application within the next sixth months. In the meantime, our focus is on recruiting directors for our board.</p>


<h3>Finances</h3>

If you are interested in setting up your own GiftFlow server, all we ask is that you make an effort not to overlap or compete with 
other online gifting networks that might be in your area.

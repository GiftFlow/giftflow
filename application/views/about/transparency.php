		<h2>GiftFlow Transparency</h2>

		<p> As an organization, we are incorporated as a non-profit in the 
		state of Connecticut. We have not yet applied for 501c3 status with the federal government. We plan on submitting
		our application within the next sixth months. In the meantime, our focus is on recruiting directors for our board.</p>


		<h3>Finances</h3>
		<p>Here are links to 'read-only' Google docs of our income and expenses.</p>

		<h3>Open Source</h3>
		<p>
		The GiftFlow source code is available online via our GitHub account. <a href='http://www.github.com/giftflow'>
		View it here.</a>
		<br />
		If you are interested in setting up your own GiftFlow server, all we ask is that you make an effort not to overlap or compete with 
		other online gifting networks that might be in your area.

By posting what you need and what you have 
to give, you contribute to a growing database of gifts and needs. 
Your post adds to the potential for successful gifts. Each gift given
is a stich woven in the fabric of our community.

The driving force behind the system is the ethic of 'pay it forward', also known as indirect reciprocity or circular giving.
Lewis Hyde described it best in his book <i>The Gift</i>:</p>
</p>
<p>"Circular giving differs from reciprocal giving in several ways. First, when the gift moves
in a circle, no one ever receives it from the same person she gives it to...When the gift moves 
in a circle its motion is beyond the control of the personal ego, and so each bearer must be part 
of the group and each donation is an act of social faith." </p>
<p>
Our team continues to grow. We are a non-profit and welcome the gifts and contributions of 
anyone who might be interested. We hope that the online community of GiftFlow creates an 
offline community of mutual interdependence and support.
